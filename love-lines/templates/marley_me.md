# Marley & Me – Messy Love
- "Your chaos is my favorite part—like a wild dog who wrecks everything but steals my heart every time."
- "We've weathered glitches, bad days, and silence together. That's not perfect; that's us—and I wouldn't trade it."
- "Even when you're a mess, you're my mess. Let me be the one who stays through the wreckage."
