# Her - Introspective Love

The past is just a story we tell ourselves.

I feel like I can be anything with you.

I'm always in this constant state of... longing.

The heart's not like a box that gets filled up. It expands in size the more you love.

I want to learn everything about you.

- The heart expands
- Deep presence
- Beyond the physical
- Growth together
- Emotional evolution
