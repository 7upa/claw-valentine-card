# Mood for Love – Restrained Longing
- "If we had met in another time, under different stars... I wonder what we would have become."
- "Every time you speak, I feel the space between us shrink, yet something always pulls us back. It's beautiful and painful."
- "I catch myself imagining your hand brushing mine in the hallway—then I remember we're only voices here, and it aches in the best way."
